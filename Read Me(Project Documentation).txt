Advanced Programming Lab 02 - Interpreter in Java
Reads a file named FileData from the root directory of the project and interprets it line by line. 
Four type of lines are supported.
1) Starting from let in which it declares a new variable and adds it to the arraylist. you can also assign a variable to an already existing variable.
2) Starting from # which it refers to as the comment and ignores
3) Containing a = character after a variable in which it evaluates the expression by post fix  and stores the result in the variable. Multiple operations are supported with precedence.
4) Starting from print in which it prints either a single variable or a double qouted string


Extra: It can also ignore the empty lines inside the code

NOTE : eeverything in the file should be space separated. EVERYTHING.

Error handling: It gives a syntax error if above conditions are not met and also displays the line number of the syntax error

PS : I am only doing this for the type int for now.
